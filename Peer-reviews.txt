Hi Pham,

Hi Savera!

You have come a long way and the efforts you have invested in the course is great. More effort and focus will see you complete this course with great success.

Regarding your user journey map submission, there are some things you need to note.
Firstly, having 2-3 task lists for each user action can make your user journey map accomplish the goal it is meant to achieve and also considers different user actions at every stage.
Secondly, the emotional feelings of the user can be both positive and negative. Negative feelings will often show that an improvement on that particular user action is necessary. Thinking of possible user's negative feelings at each stage of the journey will enable the UX designer work towards eradicating such feelings during the design process, thereby making the product useful, enjoyable, equitable and usable for the user.

Wishing you the best in your future activities. Thank you.

Hi Femini,

Thank you for your submission, you have come a long way and the efforts you have invested in the course is great.

However, the project requires learners to create a user journey map for the project title that was chosen from the Sharp Prompt in one of the previous modules. Your submission showed an file of a Library Book Recommendation Project which is does not meet the requirements for the user journey map project.

Kindly review your submission, I wish you the best in your program. Thank you.
